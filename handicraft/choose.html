              This is the first item's accordion body. It is shown by default,
              until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use
              to style each element. These classes control the overall
              appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions.
              You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our
              default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML
              can go within the accordion-body, though the transition does limit
              overflow.
